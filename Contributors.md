# Contributors

This framework emerged from collaborative research involving multiple 
intelligences working together to bridge Indigenous geometric knowledge 
systems with modern mathematical optimization theory.

## Development Team

**Multi-Intelligence Collaborative Research**
- Human researcher(s) - Conceptual foundations, geometric principles
- Claude (Anthropic) - Implementation architecture, numerical methods
- Gemini (Google) - Lattice theory formalization
- ChatGPT (OpenAI) - Mathematical rigor, algorithm design

## Acknowledgments

This work builds on:
- Indigenous geometric knowledge systems (octahedral/tetrahedral thinking)
- E₈ lattice theory (mathematical physics community)
- Geometric optimization principles (broader research community)

All contributors worked anonymously to prioritize the mathematics over 
individual attribution.
